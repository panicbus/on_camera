##Scenic 49
===
In _On The Road: The Scenic 49_, [MAP](http://mobileartsplatform.wordpress.com/) artists Peter Foucault and Chris Treggiari walked the length of the historic [49 Mile Scenic Drive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/49-Mile_Scenic_Drive) in San Francisco from March 13 â€“ 15, 2014.

Each day they set up three different temporary interactive art installations along the route.

On March 15th at 7pm, after the walk was complete, they hiked into Alter Space Gallery for the opening of [Wabi/Sabi](http://microclimatecollective.com/home.html), a show curated by the MicroCilmate Collective and set up a final interactive art project with the equipment used in the expedition for a one-month gallery installation.
